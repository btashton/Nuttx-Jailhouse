 * Tickless OS Support.
 *
 * When CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS is enabled, all support for timer interrupts
 * is suppressed and the platform specific code is expected to provide the
 * following custom functions.
 *
 *   void sim_timer_initialize(void): Initializes the timer facilities.  Called
 *     early in the intialization sequence (by up_intialize()).
 *   int up_timer_gettime(FAR struct timespec *ts):  Returns the current
 *     time from the platform specific time source.
 *   int up_timer_cancel(void):  Cancels the interval timer.
 *   int up_timer_start(FAR const struct timespec *ts): Start (or re-starts)
 *     the interval timer.
 *
 * The RTOS will provide the following interfaces for use by the platform-
 * specific interval timer implementation:
 *
 *   void sched_timer_expiration(void):  Called by the platform-specific
 *     logic when the interval timer expires.

 * Name: x86_64_timer_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   Initializes all platform-specific timer facilities.  This function is
 *   called early in the initialization sequence by up_intialize().
 *   On return, the current up-time should be available from
 *   up_timer_gettime() and the interval timer is ready for use (but not
 *   actively timing.
 *
 *   Provided by platform-specific code and called from the architecture-
 *   specific logic.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   Called early in the initialization sequence before any special
 *   concurrency protections are required.
